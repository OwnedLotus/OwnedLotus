- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OwnedLotus
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things Programming
This includes things such as MAUI, Blazor, ML.Net, UnityEngine, Bevy, and all kinds of development.
I have an interest in learning Rust in depth and I am interested in building 
efficient applications in both of the languages.

- ðŸŒ± I wll be creating applications as I find interesting and useful. Most of my project start because of a small repeated calculation
- or some little factoid that I wanted to program.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me
