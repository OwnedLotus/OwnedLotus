- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OwnedLotus
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things C and C#
This includes things such as XAMARIN/Maui, Razor, ML.Net, and UnityEngine.
I am also interested in how OpenGL operates with C programming, so I may have some projects attempting this.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Razor Page syntax and Blazor with C#.
